# code_for_AOH

Scripts to produce AOH maps for birds and mammals with the [aoh package](https://github.com/prioritizr/aoh) in R 4.2.1
at 100 m and 1 km resolutions.

We also provide code to validate the 100 m AOH maps using GDAL and R.

Each R script starts with a brief description of its use.

The INPUT data necessary to run the scripts are available upon request at the [IUCN Red List](https://www.iucnredlist.org/).

Species range maps were saved as geopackages; data on habitat preferences in spreadsheets.
